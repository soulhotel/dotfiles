- Color - custom .color file.
- App Style - Darkly (I think I compiled this with minimal changes to spacing in the cpp file but just Darkly is good enough)
- Plasma Style - personal fork of flatremix
- Window Dec - [Klassy](https://github.com/paulmcauley/klassy) with custom window controls
- Icons - [Fluent](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Fluent-kde) 
- Mouse - [Bibata Modern Ice](https://store.kde.org/p/1197198) 
- Wallpaper - [Nothing1](https://www.pling.com/p/2116657/) 
- [RWC](https://github.com/matinlotfali/KDE-Rounded-Corners) - for consistent window borders
- [Betterblur](https://github.com/taj-ny/kwin-effects-forceblur) - For better blur and refractions

Almost everything is modified/custom. The included `home/.config/kwinrc` file should not replace your original kwinrc file. It's just a reference for betterblur and RWC settings. The entire setup has been stable without any additional tweaking or maintenance needed for as long as I've been using it; but Betterblurs `dynamic blur behind windows` is going through issues at the moment with KDE's 6.5.2 release.
